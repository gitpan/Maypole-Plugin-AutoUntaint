Revision history for Maypole-Plugin-AutoUntaint

0.07    Tues 28 Jun 2005 12:40
        - fixed bug in auto_untaint to catch non-existent classes (thanks Will Hawes)

0.05    Tues 31 May 2005 21:15
        - moved installation of CDBI::P::AutoUntaint::auto_untaint() into model 
            from start of MM::P::AutoUntaint::auto_untaint() to setup(). Otherwise, 
            custom model classes were not yet loaded when I tried to install CDBI::Plugin::Type
            into them.
        - removed call to auto_untaint() from setup() - it resulted in 2 calls to auto_untaint()

        - loads CDBI::Plugin::Type into the model class, which is now 
            needed by CDBI::Plugin::AutoUntaint
        - using CDBI::Plugin::AutoUntaint's strict mode
